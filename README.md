# Grey-Rectangle
the best part of virtual meetings, but in real life

Bring the best parts of virtual meetings into real-life meetings! Turn every face around you into a grey rectangle. Because why not? Also because I had this idea at 12:30am and couldn't resist the urge to build this. So it's 1am now.

All this project does is using Apple's Vision API, it places a rectangle on someone's face. 

Now when someone complains about seeing a bunch of grey boxes during virtual meetings, they can also see them during physical meetings.
